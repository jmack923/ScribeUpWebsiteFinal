GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL: Simultaneous Responsive Sync

- Never Break Mobile: Whenever you design, update, or tweak a layout for desktop/web, you MUST simultaneously write, update, and verify the corresponding responsive behavior for:
  - @media (max-width: 768px)
  - @media (max-width: 1024px)

- Mobile Best Practices:
  - If you add a new horizontal row on desktop, ensure it stacks cleanly on mobile.
  - If you add or change text, ensure it wraps cleanly (prefer `text-wrap: balance`) and scales down appropriately on mobile.
  - If you add or change a button, ensure it becomes a full-width touch target on mobile:
    - width: 100%
    - height: 52px
    - border-radius: 12px
    - stacked vertically with a 12px gap when there are multiple CTAs.

- Workflow Requirement:
  - For every change you propose, explicitly state:
    - “Here is the desktop update, AND here is how I secured the mobile/tablet views to match.”
